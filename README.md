# RedisDashboard (UI)

A lightweight React-based dashboard for interacting with a custom **Redis-compatible server implementation** (built as part of the Codecrafters Redis challenge).  
The UI provides a simple way to browse keys, inspect values, monitor server stats, and run arbitrary Redis commands.

---

## âœ¨ Features
- **Keys list** with basic metadata (name, type)  
- **Key details viewer** for common types (string, list, set, hash, zset, stream)  
- **Command terminal** to run arbitrary Redis commands  
- **Server INFO & stats bar** (role, memory usage, connected clients, etc.)  
- **Create and delete keys** directly from the UI  
- **Basic set operations** from the UI
